# FunCore

FunCore is the core plugin behind all of The Apocalypse MC's plugins. It contains useful tools and libraries that make
our plugins tick. It includes tools such as a colored logger, JSON serialization libraries, localization support, and
much more.

## Contributors

FunCore currently does not have any other dependencies besides Spigot 1.8.8. Just add the spigot-1.8.8 jar to yor classpath and you'll be good to go! To compile, simply export a Jar like you normally would (Google a tutorial if you don't know how), and test it out! If it works, please submit a pull request and it will be reviewed as soon as possible. Note: Dependencies may be added in the future, so be sure to check this README periodically, as well as the changelogs, for upddates regarding dependencies.
